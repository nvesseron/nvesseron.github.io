About me
=====
I am a PhD student at CREST, ENSAE – Institut Polytechnique de Paris since October 2022, under the supervision of Marco Cuturi. Currently, I am also a research intern at Adobe Research in Paris, where I work with Elie Michel on computer graphics, focusing on Gaussian splatting.

Research Interests
=====
My research lies at the intersection of optimal transport, generative modeling, and sampling. I aim to leverage the theory of optimal transport to develop novel generative methods and design algorithms capable of sampling from complex, multimodal distributions. In parallel, a central objective of my thesis is to explore and apply new neural network architectures to address problems within the field of optimal transport.
